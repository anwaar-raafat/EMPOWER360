🔍 Key Insights
1. Turnover Drivers

Terminated employees show slightly higher averages in overtime and sick leave — indicators that may point to workload challenges or disengagement.

2. Compensation Differences

Higher average salaries among terminated employees suggest the loss of experienced staff, leading to increased replacement cost.

3. Retention Overview

Overall retention is strong (78% active), but specific departments show higher turnover and may require attention.

💡 Recommendations

Monitor workload indicators to prevent burnout and reduce turnover risk.

Enhance retention programs in departments with recurring termination patterns.

Review salary structure to ensure fairness and reduce the loss of high-performing employees.

Use performance signals (overtime, sick days, ratings) to flag at-risk employees early.
